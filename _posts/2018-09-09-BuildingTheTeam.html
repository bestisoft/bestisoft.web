            <p class="card-text">To have a strong, coherent and dedicated team is not enough to be nice and do a good job in the office only. Activities outside the office can help strengthen the team and encourage the team spirit we all aim for. This month we went to play a competitive sport - paintball. We won't say who won, but rest assured shots were fired and people were hit. We are all a bunch of straight shooters! Kudos team Bestisoft!</p>
